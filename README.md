# React project using context api

# Step1 : Started with class based components then convert them into functional hooks

# Step 2: Manage all states and methods from context. 
#         Created GithubContext --> GithubState --> GithubReducer
#         GithubContext: context is created using createContext()
#         GithubState: all states/actions are initialized here and dispatch to reducer in the form of object including type and payload.
#         GithubReducer: Reducer is a function which controls all the states.

# Step 3: Deployed using netlify cli.
